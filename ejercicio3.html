        My dog Sasha is my best friend. She likes to choose the soccer ball when I practice. It is so funny to 
        see her running down the field trying to catch the ball with her mouth. It just wont's fit!

        Once Sasha saved my life. When I was only 4 years old, I started to go into the street to get a ball 
        that had rolled across the street. Of course I did not think to look for cars! Sasha got in front of me 
        and knocked me backwards onto the sidewalk. I was mad until I saw the car go by where I would have been. 
        Then I was so happy that Sasha was smarter than I was!
